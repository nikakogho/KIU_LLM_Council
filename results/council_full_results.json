If |k - last| ≠ 1, add dp[mask][last] to dp[mask | (1 << (k-1))][k].\n\nCompute until mask = 255 (2^8 - 1), summing dp[255][j] for all j to get the total.\n\nAfter performing this computation, the result is 10,368 valid permutations.\n\nThis approach systematically handles constraints and avoids the overcounting issues in the original inclusion-exclusion method.",

    "winner_text": "The 100 prisoners problem presents a scenario where 100 prisoners must each find a box containing their own prisoner number. They are allowed to open 50 boxes each. If even one prisoner fails, all prisoners fail. They can strategize beforehand but cannot communicate after the boxes are opened.\n\nA naive strategy of each prisoner randomly choosing 50 boxes yields a success probability of $(1/2)^{100}$, which is vanishingly small.\n\nThe optimal strategy involves prisoners following \"chains.\" Each prisoner *i* starts by opening the box labeled with their own number, *i*. Inside, they find another number, say *j*. They then open box *j*, find another number *k*, and so on. They continue this chain until they find their own number or have opened 50 boxes.\n\nThis strategy works because the arrangement of numbers in the boxes forms a permutation, which can be decomposed into disjoint cycles. For example, if box 1 contains 5, box 5 contains 20, and box 20 contains 1, this forms a cycle (1 -> 5 -> 20 -> 1). A prisoner will find their number if and only if their number belongs to a cycle of length 50 or less. If a prisoner's number is part of a cycle longer than 50, they will inevitably fail to find it within their 50 attempts.\n\nThe group succeeds if and only if *no* cycle in the permutation of 100 numbers is longer than 50. The probability of this occurring for a random permutation of *n* elements, where each prisoner can open *n/2* boxes, is the probability that the longest cycle has length at most *n/2*.\n\nFor *n* = 100, this probability is approximately 0.3118, or about 31.18%. This value is derived from the analysis of random permutations and their cycle structures. As *n* approaches infinity, this probability converges to $1 - \\ln(2) \\approx 0.3069$. This chain-following strategy is provably optimal because it maximizes the chance of avoiding long cycles.",

We need to find the equivalent resistance between two opposite corners connected by a body diagonal.\n\n## Solution\n\n**Step 1: Identify Symmetry**\nLabel the starting corner A and the opposite corner B. Due to cubic symmetry, vertices can be grouped by their distance from A:\n- Group 1: 3 vertices adjacent to A (distance 1 edge)\n- Group 2: 3 vertices adjacent to B (distance 1 edge from B)\n- Group 3: Just vertex B\n\n**Step 2: Apply Symmetry Principle**\nBy cubic symmetry, all vertices in Group 1 must be at the same potential when current flows from A to B. Similarly, all vertices in Group 2 are at the same potential. This symmetry is rigorous: any rotation of the cube that preserves the A-B diagonal maps Group 1 vertices to each other and Group 2 vertices to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Current Flow Using Symmetry**\n\n*From A to Group 1:*\nCurrent I enters A and splits equally among 3 resistors (by symmetry, each carries I/3).\n- Voltage drop: V₁ = (I/3)·R\n- Equivalent resistance: R/3\n\n*From Group 1 to Group 2:*\nEach Group 1 vertex connects to exactly 2 Group 2 vertices.

We need their relative velocity as measured from one ship's reference frame.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Framework\nClassical velocity addition (v₁ + v₂) fails at relativistic speeds. We must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\n**v_rel = (v_B - v_A) / (1 - v_A·v_B/c²)**\n\nwhere v_A and v_B are velocities relative to a stationary reference frame (the station).\n\n### Step 2: Define Variables\n- Spaceship A: v_A = +0.9c (moving in positive direction)\n- Spaceship B: v_B = -0.9c (moving in negative direction, approaching A)\n- We calculate the velocity of B as observed from A's reference frame\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formula\n\nv_rel = (-0.9c - 0.9c) / (1 - (0.9c)(-0.9c)/c²)\n\nv_rel = (-1.8c) / (1 - (-0.81))\n\nv_rel = (-1.8c) / (1 + 0.81)\n\nv_rel = -1.8c / 1.81\n\nv_rel = **-0.994c**\n\nThe magnitude of the relative velocity is **0.994c** (or 99.4% the speed of light).\n\nThe negative sign indicates B approaches A from the opposite direction, which is expected given our setup.\n\n### Step 4: Verification\n- Classical (incorrect) result: 0.9c + 0.9c = 1.8c ✗ (exceeds c, violates relativity)\n- Relativistic result: 0.994c ✓ (less than c, as required)\n\n### Common Pitfall\nA frequent error is applying classical velocity addition at relativistic speeds. The denominator term (1 - v_A·v_B/c²) is crucial—it accounts for time dilation and length contraction effects that prevent any relative velocity from exceeding c.\n\n## Key Insight\nEven though each ship travels at 0.9c relative to the station, their relative closing speed is only 0.994c—not 1.8c. The relativistic formula ensures causality is preserved and no relative velocity exceeds the speed of light.\n\n## Answer\n**The relative velocity between the two spaceships is approximately 0.994c or 298,200 km/s.**",

    "winner_text": "### Solution: Probability of Three Random Points Forming an Acute Triangle\n\n**Step 1: Problem Understanding**  \nWe need to find the probability that three randomly selected points on a circle form an acute triangle, meaning all interior angles are less than 90 degrees. For a triangle inscribed in a circle, this occurs if and only if the circle's center lies strictly inside the triangle, which is equivalent to each of the three arcs between the points being less than 180 degrees (π radians).\n\n**Step 2: Geometric Insight**  \nFix one point at angle 0 for simplicity. Let the other two points be at angles θ and φ, where 0 < θ < φ < 2π. The arcs are θ, φ - θ, and 2π - φ. For the triangle to be acute, all arcs must be less than π:  \n- θ < π  \n- φ - θ < π  \n- 2π - φ < π ⇒ φ > π  \n\n**Step 3: Probability Calculation**  \nThe sample space for (θ, φ) is the region 0 < θ < φ < 2π, which forms a right triangle with area (1/2) × (2π) × (2π) = 2π².  \n\nThe favorable region requires:  \n- θ > 0 and θ < π  \n- φ > max(θ, π)  \n- φ < min(θ + π, 2π)  \n\nIntegrating over this region:  \n- For θ from 0 to π, φ ranges from max(θ, π) to min(θ + π, 2π).  \n- Split into cases: For θ from 0 to π, if θ < π, then φ from π to θ + π (since θ + π < 2π for θ < π).  \n\nThe favorable area is calculated as: ∫ from θ=0 to π of [min(θ + π, 2π) - max(θ, π)] dθ = ∫ from 0 to π (θ + π - π) dθ = ∫ from 0 to π θ dθ = [θ²/2] from 0 to π = π²/2.  \n\nThus, the probability is (favorable area) / (total area) = (π²/2) / (2π²) = 1/4.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**  \nThe probability that three random points on a circle form an acute triangle is 1/4.",

By energy conservation:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m v^2 = E - V(x) = E - k|x|$$\n\n$$v(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(E - k|x|)}{m}}$$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Integral**\n\nBy symmetry, integrate from 0 to E/k and multiply by 4:\n\n$$T = 4 \\int_0^{E/k} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2(E - kx)}{m}}}$$\n\n$$T = 4\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2}} \\int_0^{E/k} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{E - kx}}$$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute Variables**\n\nLet u = E - kx, so du = -k dx:\n\n$$T = 4\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2}} \\int_E^0 \\frac{-du/k}{\\sqrt{u}} = \\frac{4}{k}\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2}} \\int_0^E \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{u}}$$\n\n$$T = \\frac{4}{k}\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2}} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{E} = \\frac{8}{k}\\sqrt{\\frac{mE}{2}}$$\n\n**Step 5: Simplify**\n\n$$\\boxed{T = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2mE}}{k} \\propto \\sqrt{E}}$$\n\n## Result\n\n**The period is proportional to √E:**\n\n$$T \\propto E^{1/2}$$\n\nThis differs markedly from the harmonic oscillator (where T is independent of E). The √E dependence arises because the potential becomes steeper away from the origin, causing faster motion at higher energies, but the increased distance traveled dominates.\n\n## Physical Interpretation\n\n- Higher energy → particle travels farther from origin\n- Distance scales as E (linear)\n- Average velocity scales as √E\n- Period = distance/velocity ∝ E/√E = √E\n\nThis result is characteristic of power-law potentials V(x) ∝ |x|ⁿ, where T ∝ E^((n-1)/2n).",

    "winner_text": "The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors required to color its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe Petersen graph is a well-known graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is 3-regular, meaning each vertex has a degree of 3.\n\nTo find its chromatic number, we establish lower and upper bounds.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\n1.  The Petersen graph contains edges, so its chromatic number is at least 2.\n2.  A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it is bipartite. The Petersen graph contains odd cycles (e.g., the outer pentagon of length 5), so it is not bipartite. Therefore, it requires at least 3 colors.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nWe need to determine if 3 colors are sufficient. While a specific attempt to 3-color the Petersen graph might lead to a conflict (as shown in the draft), this does not prove that 3 colors are insufficient. It only shows that a particular coloring strategy failed.\n\nIn fact, the Petersen graph *is* 3-colorable. A valid 3-coloring can be achieved. For instance, consider the vertices arranged in two cycles: an outer pentagon ($v_1, \\dots, v_5$) and an inner pentagram ($u_1, \\dots, u_5$), where $u_i$ is connected to $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ (indices modulo 5), and the $u_i$ vertices form a cycle.\n\nA valid 3-coloring (using colors 1, 2, 3) is:\n*   Outer vertices: $v_1=1, v_2=2, v_3=3, v_4=1, v_5=2$.\n*   Inner vertices: $u_1=3, u_2=1, u_3=2, u_4=3, u_5=1$.\n\nLet's verify this coloring:\n*   Adjacent outer vertices have different colors (e.g., $v_1=1, v_2=2$).\n*   Each inner vertex $u_i$ is connected to two outer vertices with different colors, and $u_i$ takes the third color (e.g., $u_1$ connected to $v_1=1, v_2=2$, so $u_1=3$).\n*   Adjacent inner vertices have different colors (e.g., $u_1=3, u_2=1$).\n\nSince 3 colors are necessary (lower bound) and sufficient (upper bound), the chromatic number of the Petersen graph is 3.",
