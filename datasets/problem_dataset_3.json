    "explanation": "Work mod 8 and mod 125, then combine by CRT (since 1000=8·125).\nMod 8: 2^{2026}≡0, 3^{2026}≡(3^2)^{1013}≡1, so sum ≡1 (mod8).\nMod 125: by Euler φ(125)=100, so a^{100}≡1 (mod125) for gcd(a,125)=1. Reduce 2026≡26 (mod100). Compute 2^{26}≡114 (mod125) and 3^{26}≡79 (mod125), so sum ≡114+79≡68 (mod125).\nNow solve x≡68 (mod125), x≡1 (mod8). Try x=68+125t: 68≡4 (mod8) and 125≡5 (mod8), so 4+5t≡1 ⇒ 5t≡5 ⇒ t≡1 (mod8). Smallest gives x=68+125=193, so the remainder is 193."

For j=0, F(1)=2^{20}=1,048,576. For j=1,…,4, numbers 1..20 contain four of each residue mod 5, so F(ω^j)=∏_{r=0}^4 (1+ω^{jr})^4 = (1+1)^4·(∏_{r=1}^4 (1+ω^{jr}))^4. The set {ω^{jr}: r=1..4} is the nontrivial 5th roots, and ∏_{r=1}^4(1+ω^r)=1, so F(ω^j)=16. Hence count = (1/5)(2^{20}+4·16)=(1/5)(1,048,640)=209,728."

Here n=2026 and k=n−k=1013. Compute s2(1013)=8 and s2(2026)=8, so v2 = 8+8−8 = 8. Hence the largest power of 2 dividing C(2026,1013) is 2^8=256."

    "explanation": "Case on d.\nIf d=1, then a+2b+3c=−4. Try c=−1 ⇒ a+2b=−1. With b∈{−1,0,1}, only (b,a)=(0,−1) or (−1,1) work. For c=0 or 1 the left side cannot reach −4 with allowed a,b. So 2 solutions.\nIf d=−1, then a+2b+3c=4. Try c=1 ⇒ a+2b=1. Only (b,a)=(0,1) or (1,−1) work. For c=0 or −1 it’s impossible. So 2 solutions.\nIf d=0, then a+2b+3c=0. Checking c=0 gives b=0,a=0; c=1 gives b=−1,a=−1; c=−1 gives b=1,a=1. So 3 solutions.\nTotal 2+2+3=7."

    "question": "How many spanning trees does the complete bipartite graph K_{3,4} have?",
    "answer": "432",
    "explanation": "For complete bipartite K_{m,n}, the number of spanning trees is m^{n−1} n^{m−1}. With (m,n)=(3,4): 3^{4−1}·4^{3−1}=3^3·4^2=27·16=432."

    "question": "How many 10-tuples of integers (x1,…,x10) satisfy x1+…+x10=20 with 0≤xi≤4?",
    "answer": "856945",
    "explanation": "Use inclusion–exclusion on the upper bound. Unbounded nonnegative solutions: C(20+10−1,9)=C(29,9). If j variables are ≥5, subtract 5 from each: remaining sum 20−5j gives C(20−5j+9,9) solutions. Thus count = Σ_{j=0}^4 (−1)^j C(10,j) C(20−5j+9,9) = 856945."

    "question": "How many residues x modulo 2026^2 satisfy x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 2026^2)?",
    "answer": "4",
    "explanation": "Factor 2026^2=(2·1013)^2=4·1013^2 with gcd(4,1013^2)=1. By CRT, the number of solutions mod 2026^2 is the product of the numbers of solutions mod 4 and mod 1013^2. Mod 4, x^2≡1 has 2 solutions (1,3). For odd prime powers p^k, x^2≡1 has exactly 2 solutions (±1), so mod 1013^2 there are 2. Hence total 2·2=4 solutions."
