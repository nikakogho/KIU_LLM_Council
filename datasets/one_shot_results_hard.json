The total number of such permutations is 2^{c(S)}(8\u2212m)!.\n- By inclusion-exclusion, the count is:\n  N = \u2211_{S \u2286 {1,\u2026,7}} (-1)^{|S|} 2^{c(S)} (8\u2212|S|)!.\n- Group by m = |S| and c: the number of S with size m and c components is C(m\u22121, c\u22121) C(8\u2212m, c) (for m\u22651). For m=0, there is 1 such S.\n- Evaluating the sum (m from 0 to 7) gives:\n  40320 \u2212 70560 + 51840 \u2212 20400 + 4608 \u2212 612 + 48 \u2212 2 = 5242.\n\nThus, there are 5242 permutations of {1,\u2026,8} with no adjacent pair differing by 1."

We want to find the number of permutations of $S$ such that for any two adjacent elements $a$ and $b$ in the permutation, $|a-b| \\neq 1$.\n\nThis is a problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nLet $N$ be the total number of permutations of $S$, which is $8!$.\nLet $A_i$ be the set of permutations where the pair $(i, i+1)$ or $(i+1, i)$ appears adjacently for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$.\n\nWe want to find $N - |\\cup_{i=1}^7 A_i|$.\n\nConsider the pairs that are forbidden: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), ..., (7,8), (8,7).\nLet's define properties $P_i$ as the property that the adjacent pair $(i, i+1)$ or $(i+1, i)$ occurs in the permutation. There are 7 such properties.\n\nIt is easier to consider the forbidden adjacent pairs as blocks.\nFor example, if we have the block (1,2), we treat it as a single unit.\n\nLet's consider the number of permutations with at least one forbidden adjacent pair.\nWe can use inclusion-exclusion.\nLet $S_k$ be the sum of the sizes of intersections of $k$ properties.\n\nConsider the case where we have a block of two adjacent numbers that differ by 1.\nFor example, the block (1,2). We can treat (1,2) as a single element. Then we are permuting 7 elements: {(1,2), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. The number of such permutations is $7!$.\nThere are 7 such pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8).\nFor each pair, we can also have the reversed order, e.g., (2,1). So there are $7 \\times 2 = 14$ possible ordered adjacent pairs.\n\nLet's use a different approach based on a known result for this type of problem. The number of permutations of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ with no adjacent elements differing by 1 is given by a recurrence relation.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of such permutations for the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nFor $n=1$, $a_1 = 1$ (permutation is (1)).\nFor $n=2$, permutations are (1,2) and (2,1). Both have adjacent elements differing by 1. So $a_2 = 0$.\nFor $n=3$, permutations are (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1).\nForbidden: (1,2,3), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,2,1).\nAllowed: (1,3,2), (3,1,2). So $a_3 = 2$.\n\nThe recurrence relation for the number of permutations of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ with no adjacent elements differing by 1 is given by:\n$a_n = (n-1) a_{n-1} + (n-2) a_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\n\nLet's verify this for $n=3$:\n$a_3 = (3-1) a_2 + (3-2) a_1 = 2 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 1 = 1$. This does not match our manual calculation of $a_3=2$.\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding of the recurrence or the problem.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem using inclusion-exclusion more carefully.\nTotal permutations = $8!$.\nLet $P_i$ be the property that the pair $(i, i+1)$ or $(i+1, i)$ appears adjacently.\nWe want to find $N - |\\cup_{i=1}^7 P_i|$.\n\nConsider the set of forbidden"

Since $p$ is prime, this implies $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nSo, $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is one solution.\n\nCase 2: $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nIf $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, then $y$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$. We can divide by $y^2$:\n$(x y^{-1})^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\nLet $z = x y^{-1}$. We are looking for solutions to $z^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\nThis equation has solutions if and only if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\nThe condition for $-1$ to be a quadratic residue modulo a prime $p$ is that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nLet's check $1013 \\pmod{4}$:\n$1013 = 4 \\times 253 + 1$.\nSo, $1013 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nThis means that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo 1013.\nTherefore, the congruence $z^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{1013}$ has exactly two solutions for $z$. Let these solutions be $i$ and $-i$ (where $i^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{1013}$).\n\nFor each $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, there are two possible values for $x$:\n$x \\equiv i y \\pmod{p}$\n$x \\equiv -i y \\pmod{p}$\n\nThere are $p-1$ possible values for $y$ such that $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nFor each of these $p-1$ values of $y$, there are 2 values of $x$.\nThis gives $(p-1) \\times 2$ solutions where $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the sum of solutions from Case 1 and Case 2:\nTotal solutions = (solutions from Case 1) + (solutions from Case 2)\nTotal solutions = $1 + 2(p-1)$\nTotal solutions = $1 + 2p - 2$\nTotal solutions = $2p - 1$.\n\nSubstituting $p = 1013$:\nTotal solutions = $2 \\times 1013 - 1$\nTotal solutions = $2026 - 1$\nTotal solutions = $2025$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2025}$."

A path goes above the line y=x if it touches or crosses the line y=x+1.\n\nConsider a path that touches or crosses the line y=x+1. Let the first point where the path touches y=x+1 be (k, k+1). Reflect the portion of the path after this point across the line y=x+1.\nIf a point (x,y) is reflected across y=x+1, its new coordinates will be (y-1, x+1).\nThe starting point of the reflected path is (0,0). The endpoint of the original path is (10,10).\nThe reflected endpoint will be (10-1, 10+1) = (9,11).\n\nSo, the number of paths from (0,0) to (10,10) that touch or cross the line y=x+1 is equal to the total number of paths from (0,0) to (9,11).\nThe number of paths from (0,0) to (9,11) is given by $\\binom{9+11}{9} = \\binom{20}{9}$.\n\nThe number of paths from (0,0) to (10,10) that stay on or below the line y=x is the total number of paths minus the number of paths that go above y=x.\nNumber of valid paths = Total paths - Paths that touch y=x+1\nNumber of valid paths = $\\binom{20}{10} - \\binom{20}{9}$\n\nWe can calculate these values:\n$\\binom{20}{10} = \\frac{20!}{10!10!} = 184756$\n$\\binom{20}{9} = \\frac{20!}{9!11!} = 167960$\n\nNumber of valid paths = $184756 - 167960 = 16796$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for Catalan numbers, which is applicable for paths from (0,0) to (n,n) that do not go above y=x.

The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31.\n1013 is not divisible by 2, 3 (sum of digits is 5), 5.\n$1013 = 7 \\times 144 + 5$\n$1013 = 11 \\times 92 + 1$\n$1013 = 13 \\times 77 + 12$\n$1013 = 17 \\times 59 + 10$\n$1013 = 19 \\times 53 + 6$\n$1013 = 23 \\times 44 + 1$\n$1013 = 29 \\times 34 + 27$\n$1013 = 31 \\times 32 + 21$\nSo, 1013 is a prime number.\n\nThus, $2026 = 2 \\times 1013$.\nThen, $2026^2 = (2 \\times 1013)^2 = 2^2 \\times 1013^2 = 4 \\times 1013^2$.\n\nWe need to solve $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4 \\times 1013^2}$.\nThis is equivalent to solving the system of congruences:\n1. $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n2. $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1013^2}$\n\nLet's solve each congruence:\n\n1. $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\nThe possible values for $x \\pmod{4}$ are 0, 1, 2, 3.\n$0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\nSo, the solutions are $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. There are 2 solutions.\n\n2. $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1013^2}$\nThis is equivalent to $(x-1)(x+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1013^2}$.\nSince 1013 is a prime number, the greatest common divisor of $x-1$ and $x+1$ can only be 1 or 2.\n$\\gcd(x-1, x+1) = \\gcd(x-1, (x+1)-(x-1)) = \\gcd(x-1, 2)$.\nSince 1013 is an odd prime, $1013^2$ is odd. If $x$ is a solution, then $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1013^2}$, which implies $x^2$ is odd, so $x$ must be odd.\nIf $x$ is odd, then $x-1$ and $x+1$ are consecutive even numbers. Their gcd is 2.\nSince $1013^2$ is odd, $\\gcd(x-1, x+1)$ cannot be divisible by 1013.\nThis means that either $1013^2$ divides $x-1$ or $1013^2$ divides $x+1$.\n\nCase 2a: $1013^2 \\mid (x-1)$. This means $x-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1013^2}$, so $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1013^2}$.\nCase 2b: $1013^2 \\mid (x+1)$. This means $"
