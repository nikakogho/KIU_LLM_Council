    "answer": "FINAL: r = 14 - 4*sqrt(6)  (approx 4.202)",
    "solution_explanation": "Tangency to both axes in the first quadrant implies the center is (r, r). Using the point-on-circle condition: (6-r)^2 + (8-r)^2 = r^2, which simplifies to r^2 - 28r + 100 = 0. Solving gives r = 14 +/- 4*sqrt(6); the smaller radius is 14 - 4*sqrt(6)."

    "answer": "FINAL: 168/5",
    "solution_explanation": "Heron's formula gives area(ABC)=84. Triangles ABD and ABC share the same altitude from A to line BC, so areas scale with their bases on BC: area(ABD) = (BD/BC)*area(ABC). With BD = (2/5)*15 = 6 and BC=15, area(ABD)=(6/15)*84=168/5."
